						The direct dynamics trajectories presented are displayed using JSmol.
						Each trajectory was generated using a density functional theory transition-state structure
						followed
						by vibrational normal mode sampling and propagation in forward and reverse directions using
						mass-weighted
						velocities with the Gaussian 16 program. Generally, a propagation step size of 0.5 femtosecond
						was used.
